# CLI_Project-KHipHopDB

This is a small CLI app that allows you to find brief profiles of some of Korea's most popular Hip/Hop and R&B artists.
Currently, the app is slightly randomized, but I hope to bring the ability to search by artist or label soon.

## To Run
After cloning the code, in your terminal:
$ ruby bin/run.rb

And follow the prompts.


## Future Work
* Gemify - Make this Ruby Gem (possibily)
* Add text search
* Add links to either Wikipedia.com, Kpopping.com, or YouTube
* Connect to Spotify (far future work)


## Notes
`databases.rb` file is included but not in use currently. This file is intact for furture separation and work.
Some methods and other code may exist in a commented out form throughout the project. This is for refactoring and accessment as this is a work is progress.
